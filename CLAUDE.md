## What This Project Is (and Isn't)

- **Is**: a public marketing site, viewable without login, presenting Dukkan as a product.
- **Is not**: the actual application (Customer/Staff/Delivery portals — those live in `frontend_product_poc`).
- **Is not**: connected to `backend_product_poc` APIs by default — this is purely static.

If something needs to become dynamic (forms, sign-up, waitlist), move it to `frontend_product_poc` as a public route.

## Commands

```bash
bun install
bun run dev               # Vite dev server
bun run build             # vue-tsc + vite build
bun run preview           # serve dist/ locally
```

## Conventions

1. **Vue 3 Composition API only**, `<script setup lang="ts">`.
2. **i18n is mandatory**: every user-facing string lives in `i18n/en/...` and `i18n/ar/...`.
3. **RTL**: use Tailwind `rtl:` and `ltr:` modifiers — verify the visual flip.
4. **Three.js scenes** stay isolated in `src/three/`; do not interleave them with UI components.
5. **No backend API calls** — this site is static files only.
6. **Cairo is the default font** — do not import additional fonts without reason.

---

## Routing

- **History mode** (clean URLs), not hash. The host serves `index.html` for unknown paths.
- **Internal navigation**: `<router-link>` or `router.push()` — never `<a href>` for in-app routes.

---

## Build Output

- `dist/` — final static assets
- Served from `haritna.net` (see `ducker_haritna/README.md` for the DNS layout)

---

## Don't Reinvent

- **Need a layout component?** Look in `src/components/` first.
- **Need shared CSS?** `src/assets/` already holds the tokens.
- **Need a 3D scene?** Start from `src/three/` — boilerplate exists.
- **Need new translations?** Add them to both `src/i18n/en/` and `src/i18n/ar/`, never just one.

## Notes for AI Assistants

- **Not here**: API routes, multi-guard auth, complex Pinia stores, electron/capacitor — all of those live in `frontend_product_poc`.
- **Here**: marketing copy, animations, 3D, SEO meta.
- **For marketing copy edits**: cross-reference `/srv/http/products_poc/docs/features*.md` for the source of truth on features.
- **For brand changes**: cross-reference `/srv/http/products_poc/docs/brand.md`.
